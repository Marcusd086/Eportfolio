FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER! I know you're not going to read this, I'd be lucky if someone looked at my application for more than 5 seconds. No room or time 
to show who I am. God forbid I put a picture of myself or give some piece of personal information that will make their HR department question if they are 
vulnerable to a discrimination suit. I am a minnow in the sea of millions trying to hop on this cashgrab lifestyle. Like 90% of others in my field, the 
goal is FANG, but only the smallest percentage of us will actually make it. What will set me apart, my certifications, my projects, or my stunning 
university transcript? None of the above, the only way to make it in this world is through good old fashioned nepotism and faking it until you make it. 
All my degree has gotten me is a Google tutorial and a piece of paper to prove I sat in a seat for four years. After working towards the big 5 for so 
long, what is it that I've put all this effort towards? Getting pushed around from department to department, being pushed to work long hours and weekends, 
encouraged not to take vacation days, and work virtually whenever I'm sick. My destiny at 30 is to be burnt out and replaced by someone younger that has
been taught all of the new methods. Hopefully by then I'll have built up a big enough of a nest egg where I can move out of a closet sized apartment that 
burnes a hole in my pocket, and move somewhere that has animals other than pigeons and rats.
