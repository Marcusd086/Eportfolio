Big Dilf said it right "Get your money up, not your funny up". I'm here to secure the bag and nothing else. I'm calculated and precise, if you need 
something done once and right, I'm your man. My life is great and my decision to come to High Point was to ensure that continued prosperity. My majors 
include computer science and data analytics with a planned masters in communication and business leadership. This makes me a unique asset that is able 
to fully understand both the business and customer needs while simultaneously taking into consideration what is required for the backend development. 
I will position myself to rapidly advance the corporate ladder. These higher positions have greater leeway for time off and increased pay providing me 
with the liberty to accomplish my dream of having a family. As an American, I define success as freedom, more specifically spending time with those 
that matter most and doing what makes all of us happy.
